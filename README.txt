    This is an incomplete collection of my childhood programs; I began
coding at the age of ~9, initially stating with a language called
SIMPLE ("SiMPLE Modular Programming Language & Environment") and
then Microsoft Small Basic.  SIMPLE has since faded into obscurity
(web.archive.org/web/20141110222049/https://www.valcon.it/simple/
was the only reference that I could find to it, and it was in
Italian somehow), but Small Basic has an online compiler at this

            Brief Description of Programs (incomplete list):

[day_counter.sb]: This program counted the number of your elapsed days,
    given your date of birth.  Interestingly, I had written it with
    quite a robust input validation system, and it also factors leap
    years and variable month lengths into account.
